# Alarm-ios-swift     

Upgraded to ios10 and swift 3!      
This project aims to create a clone of the apple's official clock alarm application for study purpose and will come with a series of tutorial (not written yet though).  

## Branch     

- swift-3.0     
swift 3.0 compatible version before refactoring. This version began at swift 1.x era and I did some wrong designs (like make the viewmodel a singleton just for trying the language feature of swift and use global variable to store state that should be passed between viewcontrollers). If you are interested in how I did it wrong, you can check it out. 

- swift-3.0.1     
swift 3.0.1 compatible version after refactoring.

- others    
some old or feature branches that not maintained.
